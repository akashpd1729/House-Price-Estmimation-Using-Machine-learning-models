## House Price Estmimation Using Machine learning models
### ● Built a model using Scikit-learn and linear regression using Bengaluru home prices dataset from Kaggle with 13321 data points.
###● Wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests and also built a website in html, css and javascript that allows users to enter home square ft area, number of bedrooms, etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
