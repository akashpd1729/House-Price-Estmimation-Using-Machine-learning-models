## House Price Estmimation Using Machine learning models
##### ● Built a model using Scikit-learn and linear regression for Bengaluru home prices dataset as house price estimation involve Prediction.
##### ● Bengaluru home prices dataset from Kaggle has 13321 data points.
##### ● During model building, following steps were done - data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross validation,etc.
##### ● Wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests and also built a website in html, css and javascript that allows users to enter home square ft area, number of bedrooms, number of bathroom,number of balcony and location toggle list. It will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
